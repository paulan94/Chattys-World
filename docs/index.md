## Project Summary:
Welcome to the home page of Chatty's World! Chatty lives in the world of Minecraft and is dictated by his supreme overlords. Chatty does not have a mind of his own, and only does what his commanders tell him to do. Chatty is given a handful of useful items to interact with the many animals and surroundings that we have summoned into his arena.

Our project is a Natural Language Processing project, where we feed our Minecraft Agent (Chatty) information, and he is to make sense of it, using things like part of speech tagging and word to vector models. We are able to observe our environment, and  program our agent to do something interesting with this information, with the use of Microsoft's Malmo API.
