Welcome to Chatty's World

[Github Repo](https://github.com/paulan94/Minecraftbois28/blob/master/docs/index.md)

Summary:
	Welcome to the home page of Chatty's World! Chatty lives in the world of Minecraft and is dictated by his supreme overlords. Chatty does not have a mind of his own, and only does what his commanders tell him to do. For this current milestone, we have implemented a working version of POS(Part of Speech) tagging using the nltk library. We used the gensim library to get a word2vector model using Google's GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin model. The load time was quite long, so we set a limit to speed things up. We also added a threshold for word similarity, so that if there wasn't a close synonym to a user-inputted word, we would ignore it completely and ask for new input. 

This is the list of available commands in Malmo some of the accepted pairs our system allows:
- __move__		(go, pass, progress, and many more)
- __strafe__	(this is a unique word, so we will only accept 'strafe')
- __pitch__		(this is a unique word, so we will only accept 'pitch')
- __turn__		(rotate, spin, revolve, twist, and more)
- __jump__		(hop, skip, and more)
- __crouch__	(squat, kneel, heel, more)
- __attack__	(strike, assault, more)
- __use__ 		(utilize, deploy, manipulate, exploit, more)
- __stop__		(halt, end, terminate, quit)
