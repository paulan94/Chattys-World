## Summary:
Welcome to the home page of Chatty's World! Chatty lives in the world of Minecraft and is dictated by his supreme overlords. Chatty does not have a mind of his own, and only does what his commanders tell him to do. Chatty is allowed to interact with the many animals we have summoned into his arena. He has access to a pool where he can fish, and a wooden hut for safety.

Our project is a Natural Language Processing project, where we feed our Minecraft Agent (Chatty) information, and he is to make sense of it, using things like part of speech tagging, and word to vector models that we have created. We are able to observe our surroundings, and  program our agent to do something interesting with this information, with the use of Microsoft's Malmo API. 


This is the list of available commands in Malmo some of the accepted pairs our system allows:
- __move__		(go, pass, progress, and many more)
- __strafe__	(this is a unique word, so we will only accept 'strafe')
- __pitch__		(this is a unique word, so we will only accept 'pitch')
- __turn__		(rotate, spin, revolve, twist, and more)
- __jump__		(hop, skip, and more)
- __crouch__	(squat, kneel, heel, more)
- __attack__	(strike, assault, more)
- __use__ 		(utilize, deploy, manipulate, exploit, more)
- __stop__		(halt, end, terminate, quit)
