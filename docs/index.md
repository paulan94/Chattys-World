What's Markdown (`.md`)?

Markdown is markup that lets you write hypertext (HTML) documents
in easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text.
No angle brackets `<></>` required for
paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, tables, etc.


This is a paragraph (in Markdown). Some more
text here.
. Change the main page of the project to be something more
interesting, by including things like images/screenshots that are appropriate to your project, links to you
source code repository, links to pages, videos, or other resources you found relevant, and/or a summary of
your project.

This is another paragraph.

This is a list:

- Orange
- Apple
- Blueberry
