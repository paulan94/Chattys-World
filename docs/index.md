What's Markdown (`.md`)?

Markdown is markup that lets you write hypertext (HTML) documents
in easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text.
No angle brackets `<></>` required for
paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, tables, etc.


This is a paragraph (in Markdown). Some more
text here.

Summary:
	Welcome to the home page of Chatty's World! Chatty lives in the world of Minecraft and is dictated by his supreme overlords. Chatty does not have a mind of his own, and only does what his commanders tell him to do. For this current milestone, we have implemented a working version of POS(Part of Speech) tagging using the nltk library. We used the gensim library to get a word2vector model using Google's GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin model. The load time was quite long, so we set a limit to speed things up. We also added a threshold for word similarity, so that if there wasn't a close synonym to a user-inputted word, we would ignore it completely and ask for new input. 

	This is the list of available commands in Malmo some of the accepted pairs our system allows:
	- **move**		(go, pass, progress, and many more)
	- **strafe**	(this is a unique word, so we will only accept 'strafe')
	- **pitch**		(this is a unique word, so we will only accept 'pitch')
	- **turn**		(rotate, spin, revolve, twist, and more)
	- **jump**		(hop, skip, and more)
	- **crouch**	(squat, kneel, heel, more)
	- **attack**	(strike, assault, more)
	- **use** 		(utilize, deploy, manipulate, exploit, more)
	- **stop**		(halt, end, terminate, quit)


This is another paragraph.
