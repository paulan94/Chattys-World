title: Proposal
---

This is our proposal page for CS 175.
This is the 2rd line.

## headers start with "##"

## The rest of the project

In a paragraph or so, mention the main idea behind your project. At the very least, you should have a sentence that clearly explains the input/output semantics of your project, i.e. what information will it take as input, and what will it produce. Mention any applications, if any, for your project.

## 2.1 Creating a Proposal Page (15 points)
	## CHECK

## 2.2 Summary of the Project (30 points)

We are going to base our project on the Natural Language Interface idea provided in the example projects slides. We expect our input to be commands, most likely in the form of a verb, along with nouns for our character and any NPCs we might encounter. The verbs will be matched with a pre-determined list of actions we will allow. We expect to use libraries that will group together synonymous words together to do the same action. Ex: “Go forward” vs. “Move forward,” will give the same result. We will be working with the Malmo platform for Minecraft.

## 2.3 AI/ML Algorithms (10 points)

We expect to use something like the kNN nearest neighbor or some sort of clustering algorithm to give more weights to certain words based on specific situations. 


## 2.4 Evaluation Plan (30 points)

As described in class, mention how you will evaluate the success of your project. In a paragraph, focus on the quantitative evaluation: what are the metrics, what are the baselines, how much you expect your approach to improve the metric by, what data will you evaluate on, etc. In another paragraph, describe what qualitative analysis you will show to verify the project works, such as what are the sanity cases for the approach, how will you visualize the internals of the algorithm to verify it works, what’s your moonshot case, i.e. it’ll be awesome and impressive if you get there. Note that these are not promises, we’re not going to hold you to what you say here, but we want to see if you are able to think about evaluation of your project in a critical manner
