This is our proposal page for CS 175.

## 2.1 Creating a Proposal Page (15 points)
	## CHECK

## 2.2 Summary of the Project (30 points)

We are going to base our project on the Natural Language Interface idea provided in the example projects slides. We expect our input to be commands, most likely in the form of a verb, along with nouns for our character and any NPCs we might encounter. The verbs will be matched with a pre-determined list of actions we will allow. We expect to use libraries that will group together synonymous words together to do the same action. Ex: “Go forward” vs. “Move forward,” will give the same result. We will be working with the Malmo platform for Minecraft.

## 2.3 AI/ML Algorithms (10 points)

We expect to use something like the kNN nearest neighbor or some sort of clustering algorithm to give more weights to certain words based on specific situations. 


## 2.4 Evaluation Plan (30 points)


We will evaluate our success by making sure that our AI is doing what it is being asked. We expect at first our AI to be unsure of things. If given a command for the first time, it will execute what it believes to be the command and then ask if it was correct. If incorrect, we plan to use algorithms to correct it. If the command was correct, the AI will not ask for verification if the same command is issued to it. We will score our success based on our AI’s ability to adapt and understand what we feed it as input.

Our project is something that we can work on for many years. We will start by adding on an initial set of actions our AI is capable of completing. We will build upon these initial actions by adding in more complex sequences of actions that require different algorithms to carry out. It would be impressive if we could have our AI interact with us and ask us for clarification when it doesn’t understand an input. It might then give a list of suggestions for what it thought we meant.
